This is a Next.js application built in Firebase Studio, ready to be deployed to Firebase App Hosting.

## Getting Started

In the development environment, you can preview your application as you make changes. The entry point for the app is `src/app/page.tsx`.

## Making Your Project Live (Deployment)

This project is configured to be deployed to **Firebase App Hosting**. To make your application live on the internet, you will need to take the following steps outside of this development environment:

1.  **Install the Firebase CLI:** If you don't have it, you'll need to install the Firebase Command Line Interface on your local machine.
2.  **Initialize Firebase:** In your project directory on your local machine, run `firebase init apphosting` to connect your project to your Firebase account.
3.  **Deploy:** Run the command `firebase apphosting:backends:deploy` to build your Next.js application and deploy it to Firebase.

After deployment, Firebase will provide you with a live URL where you can access your application.
